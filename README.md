    Problem statement 
Traveling can be exciting, but also stressful. You have to plan your itinerary, book your flights and hotels, pack your bags, check-in online, navigate airports and unfamiliar destinations, and deal with unexpected issues along the way. Wouldn't it be nice if you had a personal travel assistant who could help you with all these tasks and more? 
Our app can help solve the problem of the often overwhelming and time-consuming process of travel planning. Many people struggle to find reliable and comprehensive information about transportation, accommodations, restaurants, and tourist attractions, and often have to navigate multiple websites and apps to plan their trips. Our app streamlines the process by providing all necessary information in one place, making it easier and more efficient for users to plan their trips. By addressing this problem, our app can save users time, reduce stress, and ultimately enhance their travel experiences. 


Feasibility 
A feasibility study for our travel planning app involves assessing whether the app is viable and sustainable in the long run. 
Technical feasibility: Our app is technically feasible, as there are already existing travel apps and technologies that offer similar services. However, we will need to ensure that the app is user-friendly, efficient, and bug-free to provide a positive user experience. 
Market feasibility: Our app has a significant market potential, as travel and tourism are rapidly growing industries. There is a high demand for travel planning services, and our app can offer a unique solution to simplify the travel planning process. We will need to conduct market research to identify our target audience and determine how we can meet their needs and preferences. 
Financial feasibility: Developing and maintaining the app will require significant financial resources, such as hiring developers, marketing, and server maintenance. We will need to generate revenue through in-app purchases, commissions from bookings, or subscription fees. We will need to conduct a thorough financial analysis to ensure that the app is profitable and sustainable. 
Legal and ethical feasibility: We will need to ensure that our app complies with legal requirements and ethical standards, such as data privacy regulations and fair business practices. We will also need to establish transparent communication with our users and provide clear information about how we use their data. 
Overall, based on the above feasibility study, our travel planning app appears to be a viable and potentially successful venture. However, we will need to continue to assess and monitor its feasibility throughout its development and launch to ensure its continued success.
